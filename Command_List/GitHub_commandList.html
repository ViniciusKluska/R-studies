#How to add to github:

git add .

git commit -am "" #"Drescription"

git push

git pull #Update local repository - In case of changing or using another PC.
    * git pull is the most aggressive alternative: it will download the remote content to the local active branch and will run the git merge command immediately to create a merge commit for the new remote content.

git clone "URL-repository" #Creat a repository inside the local directory.

git branch #show branchs

git checkout branchname #switch to "branchname"

git checkout -b branchname #Creat new branch

git merge branchname #I need more knowledge abot that, serach for it (merge; rebase)

git fetch <remote></branch> It will download the remote content, but will not update the working state of the local repository, leaving the current job intact.
    *git fetch --all A powerful command that searches for all registered remotes and their ramifications
    *git fetch --dry--run This option will run a demo of the command, resulting in examples of actions that will happen during the search but will not be applied. Afterall, why not to ask to git itself?
    *git fetch origin This command displays the branches that have been downloaded

git branch -D branchname #delete branch

git push origin branchname #send to github a new branch
    #Open URL link and follow the instruction to creat a pull request and finally merge to main_branch
