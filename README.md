# R-studies
This is an initiative from an ungraduated economics science student trying to get out of Excel.

I'm trying to lear this new language before a graduate.

Thanks to all of those who gave me some kind of help to make it possible:

 -Rafael Kluska (Mentor on new technologys and everything related to keep pushing me foward)
 -Adriana Sbicca (Mentor on graduation issues)
 -Luana Welter (Holding my pieces together)
 -Iêda Maria Cruz Araújo Kluska (Holding my sanity and feelings on place and teaching me everything related to "how to live")
 -João Bartolomeu Kluska (Gave me all the words and knowledge that drove myself to where I am)
 -Felipe Araújo Kluska (Gave me the right words in the right time - thanks for giving myself the boosts on self confidence - without knowing you were doing it)
 -Beatriz Araújo Kluska (CEO on Happines and psichology in Vinícius Kluska enterprise).

Abstract:
    I'm Vinicius Araújo Kluska. Yesterday - 24/05/2021 - I asked my older brother (Rafa) how to write some commands in R to solve some econometry exercises and as standard the answer was not direct. Thank you for not being direct, maybe you created a Tony Stark (perfect world) or just a more complete economist (still a dream, completely attainable, but a year and a half away). The question was about how to access the data of an Excel spreadsheet through R. The question is simple, but with a second sense, how I use R without learning it, given that I was lazy because I already knew Excel in depth, and it seemed quite complete and sufficient to me at that time to solve my econometry exercises. The answer was far from expected (write this line of code, wait for it to work, write this other and solved, would never write anything in R), but it was more like, man, do you even know what R is? I knew that it was a programming language and that R is the tool that I should use, because professors use it, to solve regression models.
