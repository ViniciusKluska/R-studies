# R-studies
This is an initiative from an ungraduated economics science student trying to get out of Excel.

I'm trying to lear this new language before a graduate.

Thanks to all of those who gave me some kind of help to make it possible:

 -Rafael Kluska (Mentor on new technologys and everything related to keep pushing me foward)
 -Adriana Sbicca (Mentor on graduation issues)
 -Luana Welter (Holding my pieces together)
 -Iêda Maria Cruz Araújo Kluska (Holding my sanity and feelings on place and teaching me everything related to "how to live")
 -João Bartolomeu Kluska (Gave me all the words and knowledge that drove myself to where I am)
 -Felipe Araújo Kluska (Gave me the right words in the right time - thanks for giving myself the boosts on self confidence - without knowing you were doing it)
 -Beatriz Araújo Kluska (CEO on Happines and psichology in Vinícius Kluska enterprise).
